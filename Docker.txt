How to search image for docker ?

Official image store : https://hub.docker.com/
China image store : https://hub.daocloud.io/

In both image store, we can search that image that we need. After searched, we can use below command to pull the image into our local machine.

Eg MySQL pull command:
docker pull mysql                     (pull mysql latest version image from official image store)
docker pull mysql:5.7                 (pull mysql image with 5.7 version from offical image store)
docker pull daocloud.io/library/mysql:latest          (pull latest mysql image from daocloud.io)
docker pull daocloud.io/library/mysql:5.7             (pull mysql with 5.7 version from daoclould.io)





docker run --name mysql57 -p 3306:3306 -v C:/Users/Bekcy/docker_data/mysql57:/var/lib/mysql -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=123456 -d mysql:5.7

docker ps 

docker ps -a

docker start xxx

docker stop xxx
